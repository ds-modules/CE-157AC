    "In this problem set, we’re going to do some relatively rudimentary analyses of similar issues here in the Bay Area. In the process, you will explore the lasting effects of urban infrastructure (specifically, housing and highways) on the way exposures vary across space and communities. To do this you’ll use a variety of easily-accessible tools provided by various government agencies. One of the purposes here is to familiarize you with these sources of data so that you might take advantage of them in your future work.\n"

    "Starting in 1970, the USEPA moved to phase-out lead in gasoline. Ethyl Corporation (now known as NewMarket Corporation), the company that produced the lead-containing additive TEL that was regularly added to gasoline to prevent engine-knock and boost octane, attempted to block this process through a lawsuit. The basis for this lawsuit: there was no scientific evidence that lead was any more harmful than the gasoline itself. This reasoning should remind you of other issues we have spoken about in class – such arguments assuring the safety of TEL have their roots in the 1920’s, and in fact in 1926 the US Surgeon General assured the public that TEL was hazardous to human health. The EPA eventually won the suit and the phase-out began 1976. In 1996 lead was completely banned from motor vehicle gasoline in the United States."

In addition to lead, traffic exhaust contains other neuro-developmental toxins, which may lead to worse outcomes when combined with lead exposure, although the science here is still in its infancy. "
