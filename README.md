# E-157AC

## Engineering, The Environment, and Society
### Professor: Khalid Kadir

#### Developer Team: Wendy Hua, Karla Palos Castellanos, Jinsu Elhance

Contains problem sets and data for Engineering 157AC, due to be released in Spring 2019.

E157AC engages students at the intersection of environmental justice, social justice, and engineering to explore how problems that are commonly defined in technical terms are at their roots deeply socially embedded. Through partnerships with community-based organizations, students are trained to recognize the socio-political nature of technical problems so that they may approach solutions in ways that prioritize social justice. Topics covered include environmental engineering as it relates to air, water, and soil contamination; race, class, and privilege; expertise; ethics; and engaged citizenship. This course cannot be used to complete any engineering technical unit requirements.
