With each chart you create, be sure to label your axes, create a chart title, and provide a simple regression line (including the R2 value). Note that you don’t need a chart legend if you only have one set of data. Remember – presentation is important! Also remember that a robust analysis would use far more in depth statistics, in particular focusing on each component of your regression model, both the size of the effect of each component as well as the significance, but for the purposes of this problem set linear regression slopes and R2 values will do.\n",
