    "--I realize that the excel spreadsheet isn't the best form of data to work with in pandas, so I recommend first copying all the data to an excel spreadsheet and saving it as a .csv.\n",

    "In addition, a lot of values will appear as ##### when you first copy them into excel, but if you click on the entry, it will have a numerical value inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "--Generally, make the data as tidy as possible (on the spreadsheet) before loading it into pandas, but its ok to have missing values in the csv file. For the ##### values however, try to fill in these with the correct population number from the original data (there's only a small handful, mostly in the population column).\n",
    "\n",
    "--IMPORTANT: be sure to change each of the column names to something smaller and more manageable. For example, the first column is currently named “Historical Emissions A Source: WRI, 2011 (Climate Analysis Indicators Tool v8) Cumulative CO2 emissions from energy, 1850–2007 (million tonnes)” which is extremely difficult to type in order to select that column. A better name could be just “CO2_emissions”\n",

    "--If pandas yells at you when you try to load the .csv (with some error such as \"can't decode byte at position 0x484\"), then try passing in encoding =\"ISO-8859-1\" as one of the arguments to the read_csv() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, after you do the steps above, when you load the data, you won't have to do so much cleaning when you finally load the data. (I think you’ll still have to drop those “Unnamed:num” columns). More importantly, the students will be much less intimidated looking at the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "My next suggestion is to create a markdown table at the beginning of the notebook specifying each variable name “CO2_emissions” on the left side and what that variable stands for “Historical Emissions …” (the full name from the original excel spreadsheet). This table will be a good reference for the students later in the notebook. (edited)\n",

Unfortunately, I can't make it to OH today, but I'm free to meet from 12-5:30pm today, and after 3:30pm tomorrow. Let me know if any of those times work for you"

With each chart you create, be sure to label your axes, create a chart title, and provide a simple regression line (including the R2 value). Note that you don’t need a chart legend if you only have one set of data. Remember – presentation is important! Also remember that a robust analysis would use far more in depth statistics, in particular focusing on each component of your regression model, both the size of the effect of each component as well as the significance, but for the purposes of this problem set linear regression slopes and R2 values will do.\n",
